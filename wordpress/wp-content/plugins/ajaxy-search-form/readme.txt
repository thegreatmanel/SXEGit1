A facebook like ajaxy live search for wordpress, this plugin uses the same functionality as facebook to retrieve the results from your blog.

== Description ==

* This plugin is a an ajax live search that uses the same theme as facebook search, it uses ajax and jQuery to get results from wordpress.

* 4 themes have been added one light and one dark to fit most blogs need and i am also available to customise each theme to suit your blog.

* this plugin can search categories, post tags, post types, taxonomies and supports woocommerce products search and more to go.

* This plugin was a scratch when i created it, Now it is competing with the best wordpress live search plugins out there, it is now supporting all customisation offered by the best live search plugins for wordpress.


== Installation ==

1. Go to plugin, click add new and search for ajax live search, Alternatively you can upload `ajaxy-search-form` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

-Styles are broken?

Each theme has its own styles and might conflict with the search form styles.

- jQuery is undefined?

i have seen a lot of blogs that are having this issue, the problem relies when you include jQuery more than once in your blog file, please note the ajax live search doesnâ€™t include custom jQuery, it uses wordpress built in jQuery script, so make sure there are no other plugins injecting another jQuery version into the HTML.
